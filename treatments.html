        <p>
            A European classic massage to release muscle tension and reduce stress.  
            The therapist uses touch techniques and massage movements throughout the body to revitalize your energy and wrap you in warmth and softness.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Polarity</h2>
        <p>
            A gentle massage focusing on the body's extremities: the scalp, hands, and feet.

            The natural healing power of Mother Earth is combined with the therapist's skilled hands, offering a warm and caressing treatment with heated basalt stones.  
            The stones, immersed in warm sesame oil and aromatic oils with deep scents, are used in massage movements, along with hot towels, to leave you with relaxed muscles and a pleasant warmth surrounding you.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Earth (Reflexology)</h2>
        <p>
            An ancient massage for the feet, combined with reflexology pressure points to relieve daily stress.  
            This focused treatment on the feet, which bear the body's full weight, has an immediate positive effect on them and the body as a whole.  
            A treatment that is both delightful and pain-relieving.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Combination</h2>
        <p>
            The therapist combines multiple elements and massage techniques to tailor a personalized massage for you, considering your specific needs.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Deep Tissue</h2>
        <p>
            A slow, deep, and focused treatment on broad areas of your body, chosen by you.  
            With targeted pressures and massage movements, it reaches the deeper layers of the body to release and dissolve tight areas.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Soft Power</h2>
        <p>
            A combination of ancient healing methods without oil.  
            The therapist uses a "rocking" energy transfer method, warmth, and pressure points to create a general sense of balance and maximum tranquility.  
            A calming energetic treatment combined with body movement.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Muscling</h2>
        <p>
            A classic combination of a body scrub in various exotic, stimulating, and awakening fragrances and textures,  
            enriched with Dead Sea vitamins and minerals, alongside a relaxing and pampering classical massage for your entire body.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Duet</h2>
        <p>
            A couple's treatment that allows you to indulge in a couples' treatment room with two therapists providing a relaxing and caressing massage.  
            The dim lighting, enchanting atmosphere, intoxicating scents, soothing music, personal touch, and professional and pampering treatment will offer you a wonderful and unique couple's experience.  
            At the end of the treatment, you are invited to enjoy refreshments and drinks.
