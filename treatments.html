        </p>
        
        <h2>Earth (Reflexology)</h2>
        <p>
            An ancient massage for the feet, combined with reflexology pressure points to relieve daily stress.  
            This focused treatment on the feet, which bear the body's full weight, has an immediate positive effect on them and the body as a whole.  
            A treatment that is both delightful and pain-relieving.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Combination</h2>

        </p>
        
        <h2>Deep Tissue</h2>
        <p>
            A slow, deep, and focused treatment on broad areas of your body, chosen by you.  
            With targeted pressures and massage movements, it reaches the deeper layers of the body to release and dissolve tight areas.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Soft Power</h2>
        <p>
            A combination of ancient healing methods without oil.  
            The therapist uses a "rocking" energy transfer method, warmth, and pressure points to create a general sense of balance and maximum tranquility.  
            A calming energetic treatment combined with body movement.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Muscling</h2>
        <p>
            A classic combination of a body scrub in various exotic, stimulating, and awakening fragrances and textures,  
            enriched with Dead Sea vitamins and minerals, alongside a relaxing and pampering classical massage for your entire body.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Duet</h2>
        <p>
